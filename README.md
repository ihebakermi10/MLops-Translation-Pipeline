# MLops-Translation-Pipeline

This project aims to create an MLOps pipeline for a translation model, including implementation details, evaluation metrics, and fine-tuning processes. 

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for setting up an MLOps pipeline for a translation model. The project includes training, evaluation, and deployment steps with a focus on automation and reproducibility.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Additional Steps
1. **Create the GitHub repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `MLops-Translation-Pipeline`.
   - Initialize it with a README file (you can replace the content with the one provided above).

2. **Upload files**:
   - Upload `requirements.txt`, `train.py`, and `val.py` to the repository.

3. **Add TensorBoard Images**:
   - Add a folder named `images` and upload the sample images for evaluation (ensure the paths in the README match the actual paths).

Let me know if you need any changes or additions to the README.md or any other parts of the repository structure. Once you confirm, I can guide you through the steps to push this content to your GitHub repository.
